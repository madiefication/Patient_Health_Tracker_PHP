### Application Stack
The project is built using a combination of frontend, backend, and database technologies that work together to deliver a cohesive and functional web application.
### Frontend
- __HTML5:__ The backbone of the web pages, providing the structure and layout of the application.
- __CSS:__ Used for styling the web pages, ensuring that the application is visually appealing and responsive across different devices.
- __JavaScript:__ Adds interactivity to the web pages, enabling dynamic content updates and form validations.
### Backend
- __PHP:__ The server-side scripting language that handles the core logic of the application. PHP is used to process form data, interact with the database, and manage sessions.
- __Apache:__ The web server that hosts the application, handling HTTP requests and serving content to the user's browser.
### Database
- __MySQL:__ A relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store, retrieve, and manage the application's data. It handles the storage of patient and doctor information, user credentials, and other relevant data.
- __phpMyAdmin:__ A web-based database management tool used to interact with the MySQL database, allowing developers to perform operations such as creating tables, running queries, and managing the database schema.
### Additional Tools and Libraries
- __jQuery:__ A fast and lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, and AJAX interactions for rapid web development.
- __XAMPP/WAMP:__ Local development environments that include Apache, MySQL, and PHP, providing an easy way to set up a server on your local machine.
